# "Longest Contiguous Increasing Range" code golf

On the 2018-02-15 meetup, we had a little code golf solving to "Longest
Contiguous Increasing Range" problem.

The different solutions that were presented are in this folder.

## Longest Contiguous Increasing Range - the problem

Given a list of integers, return the index that denotes the longest contiguous
increasing range. For example:

Given the list

`1, 3, 5, -9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 78484348, 11, 12 ,13, 0, -1, 343, 1222, 0`

The output should be:

`(3, 8)`

Since the longest contiguous increasing range is

`-9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 78484348`

It starts on the 3rd element and ends on the 8th.
